# Astro 528 Lab 2

Before starting this lab, make sure you've successfully gotten setup to use git, Julia and Pluto.
The previous lab contained detailed instructions for using the Pluto notebook server.  

Remember, that you need follow the provided link to create your own private copy of this lab's repository on GitHub.com.   See the
[help on the course website](https://psuastro528.github.io/Fall2025/tips) for instructions on getting setup to use Lynx, cloning, commiting, pushing and submiting your work

## Exercise 1:  Benchmarking Code, Big-O notation, Compute vs Memory Limits
- Goal 1: Benchmark functions accurately
- Goal 2: Predict cost of an algorithm based on Big-O notation
- Goal 3: Identify real world complications that affect scaling

From your Pluto notebook server, work through ex1.jl.

## Exercise 2:  Assertions, Unit Tests & Continuous Integration Testing
- Goal 1:  Implement effective assertions
- Goal 2:  Implement effective unit tests
- Goal 3:  Setup continuous integration testing

From your Pluto notebook server, work through ex2.jl.

## Exercise 3:  Numerical Stability of N-body Integration
- Goal 1:  Integrate differential equations
- Goal 2:  Compare the accuracy of results as a function of time step, order and algorithm
- Goal 3:  Recognize importance of numerical stability

From your Pluto notebook server, work through ex3.jl.
